## In Progress

- None.

## Recently Completed

- **Preflight version selection diagnostics: ordering + source metadata** (2026-03-10)
  - Added explicit ordering metadata across preflight version compare/list responses, including selection ordering basis for:
    - latest manual saved comparisons
    - autosave vs manual/snapshot comparisons
    - simulation-run-indexed manual comparison selectors
  - Added deterministic version source metadata in compare responses:
    - per-version source path checks (`version_dir_within_versions_root`, `version_json_within_versions_root`)
    - resolved version JSON mtime timestamps (`version_json_mtime_utc`)
    - timestamp provenance (`timestamp_from_version_id` for saved versions)
  - Expanded `list_preflight_versions` and run-id manual version listings with:
    - `ordering_basis` and root metadata
    - per-entry `timestamp_source`, `version_json_mtime_utc`, and source path checks
  - Added regression assertions in `tests/test_preflight.py` to lock ordering/source-metadata behavior.
  - Why: improves reproducibility and debugging by making version selection semantics explicit and auditable for both human users and AI agents.

- **Preflight cycle detection for LV/assembly placement hierarchy** (2026-03-10)
  - Added deterministic graph traversal in `ProjectManager.run_preflight_checks()` to detect recursive placement loops across:
    - logical volume → logical volume
    - logical volume ↔ assembly
    - assembly ↔ assembly
  - New preflight error code: `placement_hierarchy_cycle` with explicit cycle path diagnostics (e.g. `LV:A -> ASM:B -> LV:A`).
  - Added cycle de-duplication + deterministic ordering for stable summaries/fingerprints.
  - Added regression tests in `tests/test_preflight.py` for both LV↔LV and LV↔ASM loops.
  - Why: recursive placement loops are high-impact topology faults that can silently poison traversal/export logic and are hard to debug without explicit path-level reporting.

- **Preflight integrity hardening for world/placement references** (2026-03-10)
  - Added new preflight error checks for:
    - missing `world_volume_ref`
    - unknown `world_volume_ref`
    - missing placement `volume_ref`
    - unknown placement `volume_ref` (LV/assembly not found)
    - world volume incorrectly referenced as a child placement
  - Added regression tests in `tests/test_preflight.py` to lock behavior.
  - Why: these are simulation-blocking topology problems that should fail fast in deterministic preflight instead of surfacing later during run/export.

## Next Candidates

1. **Preflight check for procedural volume references (replica/division/parameterised)**
   - Validate referenced target volumes exist and bounds are sane before simulation.
   - Impact: medium (catches stale references outside plain `physvol`).

2. **Selection metadata consistency coverage across all preflight compare routes**
   - Add route-level regression checks to ensure `selection.ordering_basis` and source metadata remain stable across every compare endpoint variant.
   - Impact: medium (prevents drift/regression in reproducibility diagnostics contract).
